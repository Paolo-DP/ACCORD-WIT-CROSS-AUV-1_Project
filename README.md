Most crossroads use a traffic light to serve as communication between human-driven
vehicles at present by conveying to the drivers when to stop and when to proceed in an
organized fashion. However, the stop and wait nature of traffic lights cause slower mobility,
which in turn leads to congestion. 

The project Agile Control Communications for COllision
Restraint Development in WIthout-Traffic-lights CROSSroads for AUtonomous Vehicles
(ACCORD WIT CROSS AUV-1 Project) is aimed to design and implement an agile system
that communicates and coordinates autonomous vehicles (AVs) entering the intersection by
adjusting their speeds and maneuvers to avoid collisions, allowing them to weave and pass
through intersection traffic and avoiding them to completely stop, leading to an increase in
the throughput of the intersection and therefore reducing congestion. 

This project involvesa software design and hardware adaptation of collision avoidance of AVs simultaneously
crossing an intersection. A centralized computer runs the Agile Control Communications
(ACC) software based on First Come First Served (FCFS) policy with the tile retrieval
process, and its performance was evaluated through a unit test. Self-driving prototype cars
were made with the desired functionality of controlling the speed and maneuvers by the
ACC software. The result is a system that can control these self-driving cars through a
crossroad with key measures such as time duration in the intersection, average speeds of
the cars, and the number of collisions.
